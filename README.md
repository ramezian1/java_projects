# 💻 Java Exercises & Projects

A collection of my Java projects demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques. There are over 15 mini projects! Feel free to take a look. Details below.

All code and projects are written and created by me, Robert Mezian. Enjoy!

## 📝 Description

This repository serves as a portfolio of Java projects, designed to showcase my proficiency in various aspects of Java development. It includes multiple independent projects, each focusing on different programming paradigms, data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. This is a work-in-progress, with ongoing additions and refinements to demonstrate a broad range of Java skills.

This project is intended for developers and technical professionals interested in observing practical implementations of Java concepts. It aims to provide clear, well-documented examples of how to apply Java in diverse scenarios.

The projects within this repository are structured to highlight:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Demonstrating principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Implementing and utilizing common data structures (e.g., lists, maps, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
* **Exception Handling:** Robust error management and handling of exceptional cases.
* **Input/Output (I/O) Operations:** Reading and writing data from various sources.
* **Multithreading and Concurrency:** Implementing concurrent tasks and managing threads.
* **Design Patterns:** Applying established design patterns for maintainable and scalable code.
* **🧪 Testing:** Writing unit tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.
* **🧹 Clean Code Practices:** Adhering to coding standards and best practices for readability and maintainability.

## 📂 Projects Included

* **Arrays**
    * `Arrays.java`: Demonstrates basic array operations.
    * `PushMethod.java`: Example of adding elements to an array.
    * `SelectionSort.java`: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
    * `binarytohex.java`: Converts binary numbers to hexadecimal.
* **Beginner_Java:**
    * `Accounts.java`:
    * `RegisterPractice.java`:
    * `Timezone.java`:

* **Blackjack**
    * `BlackjackGame.java`: This Java program simulates a basic version of the Blackjack card game. Players can place bets, hit, stand, and double down against a dealer. The game includes insurance functionality and handles Blackjack payouts.
      
* **Phonebook**
    * `Phonebook.java`: This repository contains a basic command-line phonebook application implemented in Java. This Java program allows users to manage a simple phonebook stored in a text file. Users can add, search for, and delete contacts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ramezian1/java_projects.git`
2.  Navigate to the specific project directory you are interested in under the `src` folder. Note that most projects are inside folders within the `src` folder. I will update this shortly.
3.  Use a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or compile and run the projects from the command line using `javac` and `java`.

## 🤝 Contributing

As this is a personal skills showcase, contributions are not expected. However, suggestions and feedback are welcome.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Adding more advanced projects showcasing specific Java technologies (e.g., Spring Boot, JavaFX).
* Improving documentation and adding more detailed explanations.
* Expanding the testing suite.

All work is created and written by Robert Mezian.
