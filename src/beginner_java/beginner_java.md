* `Accounts.java`: This program demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java by simulating bank account operations. It defines a `BankAccount` class with attributes like user name, account number, and due                              date, and methods to simulate credit charges, cash advances, and payments. This example illustrates how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Java.

* `RegisterPractice.java`: This program simulates a cash register by taking a monetary amount as input and calculating the breakdown of bills and coins needed to represent that amount. It demonstrates the use of variables, data                                  types, arithmetic operations, and user input handling in Java.

* `Timezone.java`: This program demonstrates how to work with time zones and date/time formatting in Java. It retrieves the current date and time and then displays it in both UTC and PST time zones. It also calculates and                                displays the current number of milliseconds and seconds that have elapsed since the start of the day.
